### Description

`Infinity` is a property of the _global object_, i.e. it is a variable in global scope.

The initial value of `Infinity` is [`Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`][0]. The value `Infinity` (positive infinity) is greater than any other number. This value behaves mathematically like infinity; for example, any positive number multiplied by `Infinity` is `Infinity`, and anything divided by `Infinity` is 0\.

Per the ECMAScript 5 specification, `Infinity` is read only (implemented in JavaScript 1.8.5  / Firefox 4).
