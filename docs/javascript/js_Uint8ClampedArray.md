## Uint8ClampedArray

### Summary

The **`Uint8ClampedArray`** typed array represents an array of 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to 0-255\. The contents are initialized to `0`. Once established, you can reference elements in the array using the object's methods, or using standard array index syntax (that is, using bracket notation).

### Syntax

    Uint8ClampedArray(length);
    Uint8ClampedArray(typedArray);
    Uint8ClampedArray(object);
    Uint8ClampedArray(buffer [, byteOffset [, length]]);

For more information about the constructor syntax and the parameters, see _[TypedArray][0]_.

### Properties

**[`Uint8ClampedArray.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT`][1]**

> Returns a number value of the element size. `1` in the case of an `Uint8ClampedArray`.

**Uint8ClampedArray.length**

> Length property whose value is 3\.

**[`Uint8ClampedArray.name`][2]**

> Returns the string value of the constructor name. In the case of the `Uint8ClampedArray` type: "Uint8ClampedArray".

**[`Uint8ClampedArray.prototype`][3]**

> Prototype for the _TypedArray_ objects.

### Methods

**[`Uint8ClampedArray.from()`][4]**

> Creates a new `Uint8ClampedArray` from an array-like or iterable object. See also [`Array.from()`][5].

> Creates a new `Uint8ClampedArray` with a variable number of arguments. See also [`Array.of()`][7].

### `Uint8ClampedArray` prototype

All `Uint8ClampedArray` objects inherit from [`%TypedArray%.prototype`][3].

### Properties

### Examples

    // From a length
    var uintc8 = new Uint8ClampedArray(2);
    uintc8[0] = 42;
    uintc8[1] = 1337;
    console.log(uintc8[0]); // 42
    console.log(uintc8[1]); // 255 (clamped)
    console.log(uintc8.length); // 2
    console.log(uintc8.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT); // 1
