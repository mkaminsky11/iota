## Int8Array

### Summary

The **`Int8Array`** typed array represents an array of twos-complement 8-bit signed integers. The contents are initialized to `0`. Once established, you can reference elements in the array using the object's methods, or using standard array index syntax (that is, using bracket notation).

### Syntax

    Int8Array(length);
    Int8Array(typedArray);
    Int8Array(object);
    Int8Array(buffer [, byteOffset [, length]]);

For more information about the constructor syntax and the parameters, see _[TypedArray][0]_.

### Properties

**[`Int8Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT`][1]**

> Returns a number value of the element size. `1` in the case of an `Int8Array`.

**Int8Array.length**

> Length property whose value is 3\.

**[`Int8Array.name`][2]**

> Returns the string value of the constructor name. In the case of the `Int8Array` type: "Int8Array".

**[`Int8Array.prototype`][3]**

> Prototype for the _TypedArray_ objects.

### Methods

**[`Int8Array.from()`][4]**

> Creates a new `Int8Array` from an array-like or iterable object. See also [`Array.from()`][5].

**[`Int8Array.of()`][6]**

> Creates a new `Int8Array` with a variable number of arguments. See also [`Array.of()`][7].

### `Int8Array` prototype

All `Int8Array` objects inherit from [`%TypedArray%.prototype`][3].

### Properties

**`Int8Array.prototype.constructor`**

> Returns the function that created an instance's prototype. This is the `Int8Array` constructor by default.

**[`Int8Array.prototype.buffer`][8] Read only **

> Returns the [`ArrayBuffer`][9] referenced by the `Int8Array` Fixed at construction time and thus **read only**.

**[`Int8Array.prototype.byteLength`][10] Read only **

> Returns the length (in bytes) of the `Int8Array` from the start of its [`ArrayBuffer`][9]. Fixed at construction time and thus **read only.**

**[`Int8Array.prototype.byteOffset`][11] Read only **

> Returns the offset (in bytes) of the `Int8Array` from the start of its [`ArrayBuffer`][9]. Fixed at construction time and thus **read only.**

**[`Int8Array.prototype.length`][12] Read only **

> Returns the number of elements hold in the `Int8Array`. Fixed at construction time and thus **read only.**

### Examples

    // From a length
    var int8 = new Int8Array(2);
    int8[0] = 42;
    console.log(int8[0]); // 42
    console.log(int8.length); // 2
    console.log(int8.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT); // 1
