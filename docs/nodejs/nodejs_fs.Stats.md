## Class: fs.Stats

## 

Objects returned from `fs.stat()`, `fs.lstat()` and `fs.fstat()` and their
synchronous counterparts are of this type.

* `stats.isFile()`
* `stats.isDirectory()`
* `stats.isBlockDevice()`
* `stats.isCharacterDevice()`
* `stats.isSymbolicLink()` (only valid with `fs.lstat()`)
* `stats.isFIFO()`
* `stats.isSocket()`

For a regular file `util.inspect(stats)` would return a string very
similar to this:

    { dev: 2114,
      ino: 48064969,
      mode: 33188,
      nlink: 1,
      uid: 85,
      gid: 100,
      rdev: 0,
      size: 527,
      blksize: 4096,
      blocks: 8,
      atime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT,
      mtime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT,
      ctime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT,
      birthtime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT }

Please note that `atime`, `mtime`, `birthtime`, and `ctime` are
instances of \[Date\]\[MDN-Date\] object and to compare the values of
these objects you should use appropriate methods. For most general
uses \[getTime()\]\[MDN-Date-getTime\] will return the number of
milliseconds elapsed since _1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC_ and this
integer should be sufficient for any comparison, however there are
additional methods which can be used for displaying fuzzy information.
More details can be found in the \[MDN JavaScript Reference\]\[MDN-Date\]
page.
