## Event: 'data'

## 

Emitted when data is received. The argument `data` will be a `Buffer` or
`String`. Encoding of data is set by `socket.setEncoding()`.
(See the \[Readable Stream\]\[\] section for more information.)

Note that the **data will be lost** if there is no listener when a `Socket`
emits a `'data'` event.
