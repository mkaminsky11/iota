## Events

## 

Many objects in Node emit events: a `net.Server` emits an event each time
a peer connects to it, a `fs.readStream` emits an event when the file is
opened. All objects which emit events are instances of `events.EventEmitter`.
You can access this module by doing: `require("events");`

Typically, event names are represented by a camel-cased string, however,
there aren't any strict restrictions on that, as any string will be accepted.

Functions can then be attached to objects, to be executed when an event
is emitted. These functions are called _listeners_. Inside a listener
function, `this` refers to the `EventEmitter` that the listener was
attached to.
