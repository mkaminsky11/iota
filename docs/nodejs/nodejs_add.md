## domain.add(emitter)

## 

Explicitly adds an emitter to the domain. If any event handlers called by
the emitter throw an error, or if the emitter emits an `error` event, it
will be routed to the domain's `error` event, just like with implicit
binding.

This also works with timers that are returned from `setInterval` and
`setTimeout`. If their callback function throws, it will be caught by
the domain 'error' handler.

If the Timer or EventEmitter was already bound to a domain, it is removed
from that one, and bound to this one instead.
