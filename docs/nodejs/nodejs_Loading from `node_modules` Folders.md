## Loading from node\_modules Folders

## 

If the module identifier passed to `require()` is not a native module,
and does not begin with `'/'`, `'../'`, or `'./'`, then node starts at the
parent directory of the current module, and adds `/node_modules`, and
attempts to load the module from that location.

If it is not found there, then it moves to the parent directory, and so
on, until the root of the file system is reached.

For example, if the file at `'/home/ry/projects/foo.js'` called
`require('bar.js')`, then node would look in the following locations, in
this order:

* `/home/ry/projects/node_modules/bar.js`
* `/home/ry/node_modules/bar.js`
* `/home/node_modules/bar.js`
* `/node_modules/bar.js`

This allows programs to localize their dependencies, so that they do not
clash.

You can require specific files or sub modules distributed with a module by
including a path suffix after the module name. For instance
`require('example-module/path/to/file')` would resolve `path/to/file`
relative to where `example-module` is located. The suffixed path follows the
same module resolution semantics.
