## Class: stream.PassThrough

## 

This is a trivial implementation of a \[Transform\]\[\] stream that simply
passes the input bytes across to the output. Its purpose is mainly
for examples and testing, but there are occasionally use cases where
it can come in handy as a building block for novel sorts of streams.
