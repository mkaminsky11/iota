## util

## 

These functions are in the module `'util'`. Use `require('util')` to
access them.

The `util` module is primarily designed to support the needs of Node's
internal APIs. Many of these utilities are useful for your own
programs. If you find that these functions are lacking for your
purposes, however, you are encouraged to write your own utilities. We
are not interested in any future additions to the `util` module that
are unnecessary for Node's internal functionality.
