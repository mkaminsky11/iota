## Additions to Error objects

## 

Any time an Error object is routed through a domain, a few extra fields
are added to it.

* `error.domain` The domain that first handled the error.
* `error.domainEmitter` The event emitter that emitted an 'error' event
with the error object.
* `error.domainBound` The callback function which was bound to the
domain, and passed an error as its first argument.
* `error.domainThrown` A boolean indicating whether the error was
thrown, emitted, or passed to a bound callback function.
