## Stat Time Values

## 

The times in the stat object have the following semantics:

* `atime` "Access Time" - Time when file data last accessed. Changed
by the `mknod(2)`, `utimes(2)`, and `read(2)` system calls.
* `mtime` "Modified Time" - Time when file data last modified.
Changed by the `mknod(2)`, `utimes(2)`, and `write(2)` system calls.
* `ctime` "Change Time" - Time when file status was last changed
(inode data modification). Changed by the `chmod(2)`, `chown(2)`,
`link(2)`, `mknod(2)`, `rename(2)`, `unlink(2)`, `utimes(2)`,
`read(2)`, and `write(2)` system calls.
* `birthtime` "Birth Time" - Time of file creation. Set once when the
file is created. On filesystems where birthtime is not available,
this field may instead hold either the `ctime` or
`1970-01-01T00:00Z` (ie, unix epoch timestamp `0`). On Darwin and
other FreeBSD variants, also set if the `atime` is explicitly set to
an earlier value than the current `birthtime` using the `utimes(2)`
system call.

Prior to Node v0.12, the `ctime` held the `birthtime` on Windows
systems. Note that as of v0.12, `ctime` is not "creation time", and
on Unix systems, it never was.
