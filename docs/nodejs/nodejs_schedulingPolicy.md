## cluster.schedulingPolicy

## 

The scheduling policy, either `cluster.SCHED_RR` for round-robin or
`cluster.SCHED_NONE` to leave it to the operating system. This is a
global setting and effectively frozen once you spawn the first worker
or call `cluster.setupMaster()`, whatever comes first.

`SCHED_RR` is the default on all operating systems except Windows.
Windows will change to `SCHED_RR` once libuv is able to effectively
distribute IOCP handles without incurring a large performance hit.

`cluster.schedulingPolicy` can also be set through the
`NODE_CLUSTER_SCHED_POLICY` environment variable. Valid
values are `"rr"` and `"none"`.
