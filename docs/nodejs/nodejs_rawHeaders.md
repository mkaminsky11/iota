## message.rawHeaders

## 

The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received.

Note that the keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a
list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the
odd-numbered offsets are the associated values.

Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged.

    // Prints something like:
    //
    // [ 'user-agent',
    //   'this is invalid because there can be only one',
    //   'User-Agent',
    //   'curl/7.22.0',
    //   'Host',
    //   '127.0.0.1:8000',
    //   'ACCEPT',
    //   '*/*' ]
    console.log(request.rawHeaders);
