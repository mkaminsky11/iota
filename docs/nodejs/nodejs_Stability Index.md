## Stability Index

## 

Throughout the documentation, you will see indications of a section's
stability. The Node.js API is still somewhat changing, and as it
matures, certain parts are more reliable than others. Some are so
proven, and so relied upon, that they are unlikely to ever change at
all. Others are brand new and experimental, or known to be hazardous
and in the process of being redesigned.

The stability indices are as follows:

    Stability: 0 - Deprecated
    This feature is known to be problematic, and changes are
    planned.  Do not rely on it.  Use of the feature may cause warnings.  Backwards
    compatibility should not be expected.

    Stability: 1 - Experimental
    This feature was introduced recently, and may change
    or be removed in future versions.  Please try it out and provide feedback.
    If it addresses a use-case that is important to you, tell the node core team.

    Stability: 2 - Unstable
    The API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had
    sufficient real-world testing to be considered stable. Backwards-compatibility
    will be maintained if reasonable.

    Stability: 3 - Stable
    The API has proven satisfactory, but cleanup in the underlying
    code may cause minor changes.  Backwards-compatibility is guaranteed.

    Stability: 4 - API Frozen
    This API has been tested extensively in production and is
    unlikely to ever have to change.

    Stability: 5 - Locked
    Unless serious bugs are found, this code will not ever
    change.  Please do not suggest changes in this area; they will be refused.
