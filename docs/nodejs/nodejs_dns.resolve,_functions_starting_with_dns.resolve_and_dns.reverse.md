## dns.resolve, functions starting with dns.resolve and dns.reverse

## 

These functions are implemented quite differently than `dns.lookup`. They do
not use `getaddrinfo(3)` and they _always_ perform a DNS query on the network.
This network communication is always done asynchronously, and does not use
libuv's threadpool.

As a result, these functions cannot have the same negative impact on other
processing that happens on libuv's threadpool that `dns.lookup` can have.

They do not use the same set of configuration files than what `dns.lookup`
uses. For instance, _they do not use the configuration from `/etc/hosts`_.
