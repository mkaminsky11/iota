<h2>Tray.Events</h2>
<p>Following events can be listened by using <code class="language-javascript">Tray.on()</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="click">click</h3>
<p>Emitted when user clicks the menu item with left mouse button.</p>
<p>And you cannot catch click with right mouse button, because it is used to show menu. Even if you're not binding a menu to a tray, you still can not listen to it. Double click events are also ignored.</p>
