<h2>App.Events</h2>
<p>Following events can be listened by using <code class="language-javascript">App.on()</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="open">open</h3>
<p>Emitted when users opened a file with your app. There is a single parameter of this event callback: Since v0.7.0, it is the full command line of the program; before that it's the argument in the command line and the event is sent multiple times for each of the arguments. For more on this, see [[Handling files and arguments]].</p>
<h3 id="reopen">reopen</h3>
<p>This is a Mac specific feature. This event is sent when the user clicks the dock icon for an already running application.</p>
