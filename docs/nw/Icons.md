## Icons

##Title bar icon
To change icon in title bar of your app, put a reference to PNG/JPG into package.json
```
{
  ... other stuff here ...
  "window": {
     "icon": "path/to/my/app.png"
  }
}
```

##Application icon
This is platform specific unfortunately.

###Windows
After creating package you would have to use resource editor to change bundled icon. Some sources recommend freeware [Resource Hacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/) which would do the trick ([example](http://www.techtalkz.com/tips-n-tricks/3866-how-change-default-icon-exe-using-resource-editor-resource-hacker.html))

Additionally, [node-webkit-builder](https://github.com/mllrsohn/node-webkit-builder) can insert your windows icon into your package.  See the [winIco](https://github.com/mllrsohn/node-webkit-builder#optionswinico) option.

[Winrar](http://www.win-rar.com/download.html) has also proven to be a great tool for this: Just select all files from your build + your .ico file and `add to Archive` marking 'create SFX archive'. Then, go to `Advanced -> SFX Options...`, and in `Setup` write up `yourmainfilename.exe` in the `Run after Extraction` textarea. 
In `Mode` Tab choose `Unpack to temporary folder` and then select `Hide All`. Last, but not least, go to `Text and Icon` tab and add a .ico there.
This will provide a standalone .exe file with its own icon, half the size (if normal NW apps are at least 40mb, this makes them 20mb), and self silent extracting when opening. No more installers, or multiple files.

###OSX
Assuming you have your icon in PNG/JPG format, you'd first need to convert it to [icns file format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Icon_Image_format). There are different ways to accomplish this, but the easiest is probably using free version of [IMG2ICNS](http://www.img2icnsapp.com/). 
Drag your image into app window and export resulting icon as ```nw.icns```. You'd need to replace default nw.icns inside ```Your.app/Contents/Resources```. Or you may want to change the name of your icon to something like  ```mysupericon.icns``` and change the value of CFBundleTypeIconFile in Your.app/Contents/Info.plist to reflect new name. Additionally, you'll also need to take the `Icon` file (generated by the "Folder" option in Img2icns) and place it inside the root of the app's Package Contents.

###Linux
You'd need to create proper [.desktop file](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_Entries).
