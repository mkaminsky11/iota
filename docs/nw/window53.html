<h2>Window.Events</h2>
<p>Following events can be listened by using <code class="language-javascript">Window.on()</code> function.

<h3>close</h3>
<p>The <code class="language-javascript">close</code> event is a special event that will affect the result of the <code class="language-javascript">Window.close()</code> function. If developer is listening to the <code class="language-javascript">close</code> event of a window, the <code class="language-javascript">Window.close()</code> call to that window will not close the window but send the <code class="language-javascript">close</code> event.</p>
<p>Usually you would do some shutdown work in the callback of <code class="language-javascript">close</code> event, and then call <code class="language-javascript">this.close(true)</code> to really close the window, which will not be caught again. Forgetting to add <code class="language-javascript">true</code> when calling <code class="language-javascript">this.close()</code> in the callback will result in infinite loop.</p>
<p>And if the shutdown work takes some time, users may feel that the app is exiting slowly, which is bad experience, so you could just hide the window in the <code class="language-javascript">close</code> event before really closing it to make a smooth user experience.</p>
<p>For use case you can see demo code of <code class="language-javascript">Window.close()</code> above.</p>
<p>Since v0.8.4 on OSX, there is a parameter on the callback of this event. Its value will be set to 'quit' if the window is being closed by pressing 'Cmd-Q' (intent to quit application). Otherwise the value is undefined. See https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/issues/430</p>

<h3>closed</h3>
<p>The <code class="language-javascript">closed</code> event is emitted <strong>after</strong> corresponding window is closed. Normally you'll not be able to get this event since after the window is closed all js objects will be released. But it's useful if you're listening this window's events in another window, whose objects will not be released.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">&lt;script&gt;
  var gui = require('nw.gui');

  // Open a new window.
  var win = gui.Window.open('popup.html');

  // Release the 'win' object here after the new window is closed.
  win.on('closed', function() {
    win = null;
  });

  // Listen to main window's close event
  gui.Window.get().on('close', function() {
    // Hide the window to give user the feeling of closing immediately
    this.hide();

    // If the new window is still open then close it.
    if (win != null)
      win.close(true);

    // After closing the new window, close the main window.
    this.close(true);
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>loading</h3>
<p><em>Requires node-webkit &gt;= v0.3.5</em></p>
<p>Emitted when the window starts to reload, normally you cannot catch this event because usually it's emitted before you actually setup the callback.</p>
<p>The only situation that you can catch this event is when you refresh the window and listen to this event in another window.</p>

<h3>loaded</h3>
<p><em>Requires node-webkit &gt;= v0.3.5</em></p>
<p>Emitted when the window is fully loaded, this event behaves the same with <code class="language-javascript">window.onload</code>, but doesn't rely on the DOM.</p>

<h3>document-start</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><code class="language-javascript">function (frame) {}</code><br />
Emitted when the document object in this window or a child iframe is available, after any files from css, but before any other DOM is constructed or any other script is run; 
* <strong>frame</strong> is the iframe object, or <code class="language-javascript">null</code> if the event is for the window.<br />
</p>
<p>See also: <code class="language-javascript">inject-js-start</code> in [[Manifest-format]]</p>

<h3>document-end</h3>
<p></p>
<p><code class="language-javascript">function (frame) {}</code>  <br />
Emitted when the document object in this window or a child iframe is loaded, before the <code class="language-javascript">onload</code> event is emitted. 
* <strong>frame</strong> is the iframe object, or <code class="language-javascript">null</code> if the event is for the window.<br />
</p>
<p>See also: <code class="language-javascript">inject-js-end</code> in [[Manifest-format]]</p>

<h3>focus</h3>
<p>Emitted when window gets focus.</p>

<h3>blur</h3>
<p>Emitted when window loses focus.</p>

<h3>minimize</h3>
<p>Emitted when window is minimized.</p>

<h3>restore</h3>
<p>Emitted when window is restored from minimize state.</p>

<h3>maximize</h3>
<p>Emitted when window is maximized.</p>

<h3>unmaximize</h3>
<p>Emitted when window is restored from maximize state. Note that on some platforms window can be resized even when maximized, so the <code class="language-javascript">unmaximize</code> may not be emitted when a maximized window is resized instead of being unmaximized</p>

<h3>move</h3>
<p><br />
Emitted after window is moved. The callback is called with 2 arguments: <code class="language-javascript">(x, y)</code> for the new location of the upper-left corner of the window.</p>

<h3>resize</h3>
<p><br />
Emitted after window is resized. The callback is called with 2 arguments: <code class="language-javascript">(width, height)</code> for the new size of the window.</p>

<h3>enter-fullscreen</h3>
<p>Emitted when window enters fullscreen state.</p>

<h3>leave-fullscreen</h3>
<p>Emitted when window leaves fullscreen state.</p>

<h3>zoom</h3>
<p>Emitted when window zooming changed. It has a parameter indicating the new zoom level. See <code class="language-javascript">Window.zoom</code> for the parameter's value definition.</p>

<h3>capturepagedone</h3>
<p>Emitted after the capturePage method is called and image data is ready. See <code class="language-javascript">Window.capturePage's</code> callback function for the parameter's value definition. </p>

<h3>devtools-opened</h3>
<p>Emitted after Devtools is opened by any means (since v0.8.0), or ready after calling <code class="language-javascript">Window.showDevTools(id, headless)</code> with <code class="language-javascript">headless</code> = <code class="language-javascript">true</code>. The event callback has an <code class="language-javascript">url</code> argument, which is the URL to load Devtools UI. See [[Devtools jail feature]] and [[Window]] for more information.</p>
<h3>devtools-closed</h3>

<h3>new-win-policy</h3>
<p></p>
<p><code class="language-javascript">function (frame, url, policy) {}</code>  <br />

<em> <strong>frame</strong> is the object of the child iframe where the request is from, or <code class="language-javascript">null</code> if it's from the top window.
</em> <strong>url</strong> is the address of the requested link
* <strong>policy</strong> is an object with the following methods:
 * <code class="language-javascript">ignore()</code> : ignore the request, navigation won't happen.
 * <code class="language-javascript">forceCurrent()</code> : force the link to be opened in the same frame
 * <code class="language-javascript">forceDownload()</code> : force the link to be a downloadable, or open by external program
 * <code class="language-javascript">forceNewWindow()</code> : force the link to be opened in a new window
 * <code class="language-javascript">forceNewPopup()</code> : force the link to be opened in a new popup window

The object <code class="language-javascript">m</code> is in the same format as the <code class="language-javascript">window</code> subfield in [[Manifest format]] (e.g. <code class="language-javascript">{"frame" : false}</code>). </p>
