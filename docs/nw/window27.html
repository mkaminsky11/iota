<h2>Window.restore()</h2>
<p>Restore window to previous state after the window is minimized, e.g. the reverse of <code class="language-javascript">minimize()</code>. It's not named <code class="language-javascript">unminimize</code> since <code class="language-javascript">restore</code> is already used commonly on Window.</p>
