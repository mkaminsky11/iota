## :left

### Summary

The `:left` CSS [page][0] [pseudo-class][1] matches any left page when printing a page. It allows to describe the styling of left-side pages.

Whether the page is left or right is decided by the major writing direction of the document. For example, if the first page has a major writing direction of left-to-right then it will be a `:right` page and if it has a major writing direction of right-to-left then it will be a `:left` page.

**Note:** You can't change all CSS properties. You can only change the the [`margin`][2], [`padding`][3], [`border`][4], and [`background`][5] properties of the page box. All other CSS properties will be ignored, and only the page box, not the document content on the page, will be affected.

### Examples

    @page :left {
    Â  margin: 2in 3in;
    }
