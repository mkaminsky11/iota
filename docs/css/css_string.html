<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The <code class="language-markup">&lt;string&gt;</code> <a  title="CSS">CSS</a> data type represents a string. It is formed by a <a   title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> characters delimited by either double (") or single (') quotes. A double quoted string cannot contain double quotes unless escaped using a backslash (\). The same practice applies for single quoted strings, they cannot contain single quotes unless escaped using a backslash (\). The backslash character must be escaped to be part of the string.</p>
<p>New lines are not accepted unless escaped by using a line feed character such as \A or \00000a. However, strings can span over several lines. In that case, the new line must be escaped using a \ as the last character of the line.</p>
<p>Characters can be described using their <a   title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#Code_point_planes_and_blocks">Unicode code point</a> in hexadecimal, when escaped using \. \27 represents the single quote (').</p>
