<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-markup">font-family</code> CSS property allows for a prioritized list of font family names and/or generic family names to be specified for the selected element. Unlike most other CSS properties, values are separated by a comma to indicate that they are alternatives. The browser will select the first font on the list that is installed on the computer, or that can be downloaded using the information provided by a <a  title="The @font-face CSS at-rule allows authors to specify online fonts to display text on their web pages. By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face eliminates the need to depend on the limited number of fonts users have installed on their computers. The @font-face at-rule may be used not only at the top level of a CSS, but also inside any CSS conditional-group at-rule."><code class="language-markup">@font-face</code></a> at-rule.</p>

<p>Web authors should always add at least one generic family in a font-family list, since there's no guarantee that a specific font is installed on the computer or can be downloaded using a <a  title="The @font-face CSS at-rule allows authors to specify online fonts to display text on their web pages. By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face eliminates the need to depend on the limited number of fonts users have installed on their computers. The @font-face at-rule may be used not only at the top level of a CSS, but also inside any CSS conditional-group at-rule."><code class="language-markup">@font-face</code></a> at-rule. The generic family lets the browser select an acceptable fallback font when needed.</p>

<p>It is often convenient to use the shorthand property <a  title="The font CSS property is either a shorthand property for setting font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size, line-height and font-family, or a way to set the element's font to a system font, using specific keywords."><code class="language-markup">font</code></a> to set <code class="language-markup">font-size</code> and other font related properties all at once.</p>

<div ><strong>Note:</strong> The <code class="language-markup">font-family</code> property specifies a list of fonts, from highest priority to lowest. Font selection does <strong>not</strong> simply stop at the first font named in the list that is on the user's system. Rather, font selection is done <strong>one character at a time</strong>, so that if an available font does not have a glyph that can display a character needed, the later available fonts are tried. However, this doesn't work in Internet Explorer 6 or earlier.<br>
<br>
When a font is only available in some <a  title="CSS/font-style">styles</a>, <a  title="CSS/font-variant">variants</a>, or <a  title="CSS/font-size">sizes</a>, those properties may also influence which font family is chosen.</div>

<h3 >Values</h3>

<table >
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><code class="language-markup">&lt;family-name&gt;</code></td>
   <td>The name of a font family. For example, "Times" and "Helvetica" are font families. Font family names containing whitespace should be quoted.</td>

  <tr>
   <td><code class="language-markup">&lt;generic-name&gt;</code></td>
   <td>
    <p>Generic font families are a fallback mechanism, a means of preserving some of the style sheet author's intent in case when none of the specified fonts are available. Generic family names are keywords and must not be quoted. A generic font family should be the a last alternative in the list of font family names.</p>

     <dd>Glyphs in cursive fonts generally have either joining strokes or other cursive characteristics beyond those of italic typefaces. The glyphs are partially or completely connected, and the result looks more like handwritten pen or brush writing than printed letterwork.</dd>

     <dd>Fantasy fonts are primarily decorative fonts that contain playful representations of characters.</dd>
