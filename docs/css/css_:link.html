<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-markup">:link</code> CSS <a  title="Pseudo-classes">pseudo-class</a> lets you select links inside elements. This will select any link which has not yet been visited, even those already styled using selector with other link-related pseudo-classes like <a  title="The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user designates an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. This style may be overridden by any other link-related pseudo-classes, that is :link, :visited, and :active, appearing in subsequent rules. In order to style appropriately links, you need to put the :hover rule after the :link and :visited rules but before the :active one, as defined by the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active."><code class="language-markup">:hover</code></a>, <a  title="The :active CSS pseudo-class matches when an element is being activated by the user. It allows the page to give a feedback that the activation has been detected by the browser. When interacting with a mouse, this is typically the time between the user presses the mouse button and releases it. The :active pseudo-class is also typically matched when using the keyboard tab key. It is frequently used on &lt;a> and &lt;button> HTML elements, but may not be limited to just those."><code class="language-markup">:active</code></a> or <a  title="The :visited CSS pseudo-class lets you select only links that have been visited. This style may be overridden by any other link-related pseudo-classes, that is :link, :hover, and :active, appearing in subsequent rules. In order to style appropriately links, you need to put the :visited rule after the :link rule but before the other ones, defined in the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active."><code class="language-markup">:visited</code></a>. In order to appropriately style links, you need to put the <code class="language-markup">:link</code> rule before the other ones, as defined by the <em>LVHA-order</em>: <code class="language-markup">:link</code> — <code class="language-markup">:visited</code> — <code class="language-markup">:hover</code> — <code class="language-markup">:active</code>. The <a  title="The :focus CSS pseudo-class is applied when a element has received focus, either from the user selecting it with the use of a keyboard or by activating with the mouse (e.g. a form input)."><code class="language-markup">:focus</code></a> pseudo-class is usually placed right before or right after <code class="language-markup">:hover</code>, depending on the expected effect.</p>
