## text-orientation

**This is an experimental technology**  
Because this technology's specification has not stabilized, check the [compatibility table][0] for the proper prefixes to use in various browsers. Also note that the syntax and behavior of an experimental technology is subject to change in future versions of browsers as the spec changes.

The `text-orientation` [CSS][1] property defines the orientation of the text in a line. This property only has an effect in vertical mode, that is when [`writing-mode`][2] is not `horizontal-tb`. It is useful to control the display of writing in languages using vertical script, but also to deal with vertical table headers.

* _[Initial value][3]_ `mixed` 
* _Applies to_ all elements, except table row groups, rows, column groups, and columns 
* _[Inherited][4]_ yes 
* _Media_ [`visual`][5] 
* _[Computed value][6]_ as specified 
* _Animatable_ no 
* _Canonical order_ the unique non-ambiguous order defined by the formal grammar

### Syntax

    [Formal syntax][7]: mixed [|][8] upright [|][8] sideways-right [|][8] sideways-left [|][8] sideways [|][8] use-glyph-orientation
    

    text-orientation: mixed
    text-orientation: upright
    text-orientation: sideways-right
    text-orientation: sideways-left
    text-orientation: sideways
    text-orientation: use-glyph-orientation
    
    text-orientation: inherit
    text-orientation: initial
    text-orientation: unset
    

### Values

**`mixed`**

> This keyword leads to have characters for horizontal-only scripts being turned 90째, while the glyphs for vertical scripts are laid out naturally.

**`upright`**

> This keyword leads to have characters for horizontal-only scripts to be laid out naturally (upright), as well as the glyphs for vertical scripts. Note that this keyword lead all characters to be considered as ltr: the used value of [`direction`][9] is `ltr`, whatever the user could try to set it to.

**`sideways-right`**

> This keyword leads to have characters laid out like if they were laid out horizontally, but with the whole line rotated 90째 to the right.

**`sideways-left`**

> This keyword leads to have characters laid out like if they were laid out horizontally, but with the whole line rotated 90째 to the left.

**`sideways`**

> This keyword leads to have characters laid out like if they were laid out horizontally, but with the whole line rotated 90째 to the right if [`writing-mode`][2] is `vertical-rl` or to the left, if it is `vertical-lr`.

**`use-glyph-orientation`**

> On SVG elements, this keyword leads to use the value of the deprecated SVG properties` glyph-orientation-vertical` and `glyph-orientation-horizontal`.

### Examples

    .myText {
      writing-mode: vertical-rl;
      text-orientation: sideways-right;
    }

For example, if a block of text contains both left-to-right and right-to-left text then the user-agent uses a complex Unicode algorithm to decide how to display the text. This property overrides this algorithm and allows the developer to control the text embedding."
