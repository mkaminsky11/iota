## font-language-override

### Summary

The **`font-language-override`** CSS property controls the usage of language-specific glyphs in a typeface.

By default, browsers use the HTML global attribute `lang` to determine the language of the text contained in an element; with this information, they use special glyphs designed for that language. For example, a lot of font have a special character for the digraph `fi`, making the dot on the `i` merge with the previous character. This ligature should not be used when displaying turkic language as they have two i (`i` and `Ä±`), one with a dot and one dotless: using the ligature would transform a dotted i in a dotless i.

Sometimes the author want to override this language: like if the typeface doesn't know about the azeri language, that, like the turkish one, has a dotless i. In that case, the `font-language-override` can be used to force the use of the turkish glyphs, better suited for azeri than the default one.
