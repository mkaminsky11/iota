<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The<code class="language-markup"> :fullscreen </code>CSS <a  title="en/CSS/Pseudo-classes">pseudo-class</a> applies to any element that's currently being displayed in full-screen mode. See <a  title="en/DOM/Using full-screen mode">Using full-screen mode</a> for details.</p>

<div >The W3C proposal uses the single word <code class="language-markup">:fullscreen</code>, that is without a dash, but both the Webkit and Gecko experimental implementations use a prefixed variant with two words linked by a dash: <code class="language-markup">:-webkit-full-screen</code> and <code class="language-markup">:-moz-full-screen</code>, respectively.</div>
