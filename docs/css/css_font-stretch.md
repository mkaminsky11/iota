## font-stretch

### Summary

The `font-stretch` CSS property selects a normal, condensed, or expanded face from a font.

![The two 'e' belong to the same fonts. One is condensed, the other normal and can be selected by 'font-stretch'.](/files/4321/Character_in_same_font_but_one_condensed.png)

This property does not change the geometry of an arbitrary font by stretching or shrinking it. Like [`font-feature-settings`][0] or [`font-variant`][1], it is merely a mean to choose the most appropriate _face_ of the font, if this one offers several of them.

**Note:******If the font provides several faces, the one fitting the best with the value of the `font-stretch` property is chosen. E.g. On OS X, in addition to the more common Bold, Regular, Italic, and BoldItalic faces, the "Helvetica Neue" font proposes a second set of faces with condensed, that is shrunk, characters: Condensed. Browsers supporting `font-stretch` will use the condensed faces for the value `ultra-condensed` to `semi-condensed` and the normal faces for the other (`normal` and all expanded values).

If the font has no condensed or expanded faces, like the default "Times New Roman" on Mac OS, `font-stretch` will not have any visible effect as the only suitable face will be used in all cases.:

* _[Initial value][2]_ `normal` 
* _Applies to_ all elements. It also applies to [`::first-letter`][3] and [`::first-line`][4]. 
* _[Inherited][5]_ yes 
* _Media_ [`visual`][6] 
* _[Computed value][7]_ as specified 
* _Animatable_ yes, as a [font stretch][8] 
* _Canonical order_ the unique non-ambiguous order defined by the formal grammar

### Syntax

    [Formal syntax][9]: normal [|][10] ultra-condensed [|][10] extra-condensed [|][10] condensed [|][10] semi-condensed [|][10] semi-expanded [|][10] expanded [|][10] extra-expanded [|][10] ultra-expanded
    

    font-stretch: ultra-condensed
    font-stretch: extra-condensed
    font-stretch: condensed
    font-stretch: semi-condensed
    font-stretch: normal
    font-stretch: semi-expanded
    font-stretch: expanded
    font-stretch: extra-expanded
    font-stretch: ultra-expanded
    
    font-stretch: inherit
    

### Values

**`normal`**

> Specifies a normal font face.

**`semi-condensed`, `condensed`, `extra-condensed`, `ultra-condensed`**

> Specifies a font face more condensed than normal, with ultra-condensed as the most condensed.

**`semi-expanded`, `expanded`, `extra-expanded`, `ultra-expanded`**

> Specifies a font face more expanded than normal, with ultra-expanded as the most expanded.

### Interpolation

Font stretch values are interpolated in discrete steps. The interpolation happens as though the ordered values are equally spaced real numbers; the result is rounded to the nearest value, with values exactly halfway between two values rounded towards the later value, that is the most expanded one.

### Examples

    h1 { font-stretch: extra-expanded }
    p  { font-stretch: condensed }
