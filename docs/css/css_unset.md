## unset

### Summary

The `unset` CSS keyword is the combination of the [`initial`][0] and [`inherit`][1] keywords. Like these two other CSS-wide keywords, it can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand [`all`][2]. This keyword _resets_ the property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent or to its initial value if not. In other words, it behaves like the `inherit` keyword in the first case and like the `initial` keyword in the second case.

### Examples

     /* give headers a green border */
     h2 { border: medium solid green }
    
     /* but make those in the sidebar use the value of the "color" property (initial value) */
     #sidebar h2 { border-color: unset; }
    

     <p style="color:red"> 
        this text is red 
           <em style="color:initial"> 
              this text is in the initial color (e.g. black)
           </em>
        this is red again
     </p>Â
