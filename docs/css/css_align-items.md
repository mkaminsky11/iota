### Syntax

    [Formal syntax][7]: flex-start [|][8] flex-end [|][8] center [|][8] baseline [|][8] stretch
    

    align-items: flex-start

    align-items: center
    align-items: baseline
    align-items: stretch
    
    align-items: inherit
    

### Values

**`flex-start`**

> The cross-start margin edge of the flex item is flushed with the cross-start edge of the line.

**`flex-end`**

> The cross-end margin edge of the flex item is flushed with the cross-end edge of the line.

**`center`**

> The flex item's margin box is centered within the line on the cross-axis. If the cross-size of the item is larger than the flex container, it will overflow equally in both directions.

**`baseline`**

> All flex items are aligned such that their baselines align. The item with the largest distance between its cross-start margin edge and its baseline is flushed with the cross-start edge of the line.

**`stretch`**

> Flex items are stretched such as the cross-size of the item's margin box is the same as the line while respecting width and height constraints.
