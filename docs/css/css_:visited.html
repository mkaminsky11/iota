<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-markup">:visited</code> CSS <a  title="Pseudo-classes">pseudo-class</a> lets you select only links that have been visited. This style may be overridden by any other link-related pseudo-classes, that is <a  title="The :link CSS pseudo-class lets you select links inside elements. This will select any link which has not yet been visited, even those already styled using selector with other link-related pseudo-classes like :hover, :active or :visited. In order to appropriately style links, you need to put the :link rule before the other ones, as defined by the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active. The :focus pseudo-class is usually placed right before or right after :hover, depending on the expected effect."><code class="language-markup">:link</code></a>, <a  title="The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user designates an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. This style may be overridden by any other link-related pseudo-classes, that is :link, :visited, and :active, appearing in subsequent rules. In order to style appropriately links, you need to put the :hover rule after the :link and :visited rules but before the :active one, as defined by the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active."><code class="language-markup">:hover</code></a>, and <a  title="The :active CSS pseudo-class matches when an element is being activated by the user. It allows the page to give a feedback that the activation has been detected by the browser. When interacting with a mouse, this is typically the time between the user presses the mouse button and releases it. The :active pseudo-class is also typically matched when using the keyboard tab key. It is frequently used on &lt;a> and &lt;button> HTML elements, but may not be limited to just those."><code class="language-markup">:active</code></a>, appearing in subsequent rules. In order to style appropriately links, you need to put the <code class="language-markup">:visited</code> rule after the <code class="language-markup">:link</code> rule but before the other ones, defined in the <em>LVHA-order</em>: <code class="language-markup">:link</code> — <code class="language-markup">:visited</code> — <code class="language-markup">:hover</code> — <code class="language-markup">:active</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>For privacy reasons, browsers strictly limit the styles you can apply using an element selected by this pseudo-class: only <a  title="The CSS color property sets the foreground color of an element's text content, and its decorations. It doesn't affect any other characteristic of the element; it should really be called text-color and would have been named so, save for historical reasons and its appearance in CSS Level 1."><code class="language-markup">color</code></a>, <a  title="The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element, either through a color value or the keyword transparent."><code class="language-markup">background-color</code></a>, <a  title="The border-color CSS property is a shorthand for setting the color of the four sides of an element's border: border-top-color, border-right-color, border-bottom-color, border-left-color"><code class="language-markup">border-color</code></a>, <a  title="The border-bottom-color CSS property sets the color of the bottom border of an element. Note that in many cases the shorthand CSS properties border-color or border-bottom are more convenient and preferable."><code class="language-markup">border-bottom-color</code></a>, <a  title="The border-left-color CSS property sets the color of the bottom border of an element. Note that in many cases the shorthand CSS properties border-color or border-left are more convenient and preferable."><code class="language-markup">border-left-color</code></a>, <a  title="The border-right-color CSS property sets the color of the right border of an element. Note that in many cases the shorthand CSS properties  border-color or border-right are more convenient and preferable."><code class="language-markup">border-right-color</code></a>, <a  title="The border-top-color CSS property sets the color of the top border of an element. Note that in many cases the shorthand CSS properties border-color or border-top are more convenient and preferable."><code class="language-markup">border-top-color</code></a>, <a  title="The outline-color CSS property sets the color of the outline of an element. An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the border edge, to make the element stand out."><code class="language-markup">outline-color</code></a>, <a  title="The column-rule-color CSS property lets you set the color of the rule drawn between columns in multi-column layouts."><code class="language-markup">column-rule-color</code></a>, <code class="language-markup">fill</code> and <code class="language-markup">stroke</code>. Note also that the alpha component will be ignored: the alpha component of the not-visited rule is used instead (except when the opacity is <code class="language-markup">0</code>, in that case the whole color is ignored, and the one of the not-visited rule is used.</p>

<p>Though the color can be changed, the method <code class="language-markup">getComputedStyle</code> will lie and always give back the value of the non-visited color.</p>
