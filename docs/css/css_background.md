## background

### Summary

The `background` CSS property is a shorthand for setting the individual background values in a single place in the style sheet.` background `can be used to set the values for one or more of: [`background-clip`][0], [`background-color`][1], [`background-image`][2], [`background-origin`][3], [`background-position`][4], [`background-repeat`][5], [`background-size`][6], and [`background-attachment`][7].

The `background` CSS shorthand property assigns explicit given values and sets missing properties to their initial values.

* _[Initial value][8]_ the concatenation of the initial values of its longhand properties:
  * `background-image`: `none`
  * `background-position`: `0% 0%`
  * `background-size`: `auto auto`
  * `background-repeat`: `repeat`
  * `background-origin`: `padding-box`
  * `background-style`: is itself a shorthand, its initial value is the concatenation of its own longhand properties
  * `background-clip`: `border-box`
  * `background-color`: `transparent` 
* _Applies to_ all elements. It also applies to [`::first-letter`][9] and [`::first-line`][10]. 
* _[Inherited][11]_ no 
* _Percentages_ The values of its longhand properties the percentage value belongs to:
  * `background-position`: refer to the size of the background positioning area minus size of background image; size refers to the width for horizontal offsets and to the height for vertical offsets
  * `background-size`: relative to the background positioning area 
* _Media_ [`visual`][12] 
* _[Computed value][13]_ as each of the properties of the shorthand:
  * `background-image`: as specified, but with URIs made absolute
  * `background-position`: a list, each item consisting of two keywords representing the origin and two offsets from that origin, each given as an absolute length (if given a [`<length>`][14]), otherwise as a percentage
  * `background-size`: as specified, with lengths made absolute
  * `background-repeat`: a list, each item consisting of two keywords, one per dimension
  * `background-origin`: as specified
  * `background-style`: is itself a shorthand, applies to the same elements as each of its longhand properties.
  * `background-clip`: as specified
  * `background-color`: If the value is translucent, the computed value will be the `rgba()` corresponding one. If it isn't, it will be the `rgb()` corresponding one. The `transparent` keyword maps to `rgba(0,0,0,0)`. 
* _Animatable_ as each of the properties of the shorthand:
  * `background-color`: yes, as a [color][15]
  * `background-image`: no
  * `background-clip`: no
  * `background-position`: yes, as a repeatable list of a simple list of a [length][16], [percentage][17] or calc(); when both values are lengths, they are interpolated as lengths; when both values are percentages, they are interpolated as percentages; otherwise, both values are converted into a calc() function that is the sum of a length and a percentage (each possibly zero), and these calc() functions have each half interpolated as real numbers. 
  * `background-size`: yes, as a repeatable list of a simple list of a [length][16], [percentage][17] or calc(); when both values are lengths, they are interpolated as lengths; when both values are percentages, they are interpolated as percentages; otherwise, both values are converted into a calc() function that is the sum of a length and a percentage (each possibly zero), and these calc() functions have each half interpolated as real numbers. . This means keyword values are not animatable.
  * `background-repeat`: no
  * `background-attachment`: no 
* _Canonical order_ order of appearance in the formal grammar of the values

### Syntax

    [Formal syntax][18]: [ [<bg-layer>][19] , ][*][20] [<final-bg-layer>][21]
                   where <bg-layer> = <bg-image> || <position> [ / <bg-size> ]? || <repeat-style> || <attachment> || <box> || <box>
                   and <final-bg-layer> =Â <bg-image> || <position> [ / <bg-size> ]? || <repeat-style> || <attachment> || <box> || <box> || <background-color>

**Note:** The [`background-color`][1] can only be defined on the last background, as there is only one background color for the whole element.

### Values

One or more of the following, in any order:

**`<attachment>`**

> See [`background-attachment`][7]

**`<box>`**

> See [`background-clip`][0]

**`<background-color>`**

**`<bg-image>`**

> See [`background-image`][2]

**<position\>**

> See [`background-position`][4]

**`<repeat-style>`**

> See [`background-repeat`][5]

**`<bg-size>`**

> See [`background-size`][6]. This property must be specified after **<position\>**, separated with the '/' character.
