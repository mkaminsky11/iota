<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The <code class="language-markup">unset</code> CSS keyword is the combination of the <a  title="The initial CSS keyword applies the initial value of a property to an element. It is allowed on every CSS property and causes the element for which it is specified to use the initial value of the property."><code class="language-markup">initial</code></a> and <a  title="The inherit CSS-value causes the element for which it is specified to take the computed value of the property from its parent element. It is allowed on every CSS property."><code class="language-markup">inherit</code></a> keywords. Like these two other CSS-wide keywords, it can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand <a  title="The CSS all shorthand property resets all properties, but unicode-bidi and direction to their initial or inherited value."><code class="language-markup">all</code></a>. This keyword <em>resets</em> the property to itsÂ inherited value if it inherits from its parent or to its initial value if not. In other words, it behaves like the <code class="language-markup">inherit</code> keyword in the first case and like the <code class="language-markup">initial</code> keyword in the second case.</p>
