<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The <code class="language-markup">&lt;integer&gt;</code> <a  title="CSS">CSS</a> data type denotes an integer number, positive or negative. There isn't any associated unit with the value. An integer consists of one or several decimal digits, 0 to 9, optionally preceded by one single + or - sign.</p>
<p>Integers are used in numerous CSS properties, e. g. <a  title="The z-index CSS property specifies the z-order of an element and its descendants. When elements overlap, z-order determines which one covers the other. An element with a larger z-index generally covers an element with a lower one."><code class="language-markup">z-index</code></a>, <a  title="The counter-increment CSS property is used to increase the value of CSS Counters by a given value. The counter's value can be reset using the counter-reset CSS property."><code class="language-markup">counter-increment</code></a>, <a  title="The column-count CSS property describes the number of columns of the element."><code class="language-markup">column-count</code></a>.</p>
<p>Also any <code class="language-markup">&lt;integer&gt;</code> CSS value is also a <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;number&gt;</code></a> CSS value, though the converse is not true.</p>
<div >
 There is no official range of valid <code class="language-markup">&lt;integer&gt;</code> values. Opera supports values up to 2<sup>15</sup>-1, IE up to 2<sup>20</sup>-1 and other browsers even higher. During the CSS3 Values cycle there were a lot of discussion about setting a minimal limit to support: the latest decision, in April 2012 during the LC phase, was [-2<sup>27</sup>-1;Â 2<sup>27</sup>-1] <a   title="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Apr/0633.html">#</a> but other values like 2<sup>24</sup>-1 and 2<sup>30</sup>-1 were also proposed <a   title="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Apr/0530.html">#</a> <a   title="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Apr/0530.html">#</a>. The latest Editor's draft doesn't list a limit anymore.</div>
<h3>Interpolation</h3>
<p>Values of the <code class="language-markup">&lt;integer&gt;</code> CSS data type can be interpolated in order to allow animations. In that case they are interpolated via integer discrete steps. The calculation is done as if they were real, floating-point numbers and the discrete value is obtained using the <a   title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_function">floor function</a>. The speed of the interpolation is determined by the <a  title="timing-function">timing function</a> associated with the animation.</p>
