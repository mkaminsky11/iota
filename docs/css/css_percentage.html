<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The <code class="language-markup">&lt;percentage&gt;</code> <a  title="CSS">CSS</a> data types represent a percentage value. Many <a  title="en/CSS_Reference">CSS properties</a> can take percentage values, often to define sizes in terms of parent objects. Percentages are formed by a <a  title=""><code class="language-markup">&lt;number&gt;</code></a> immediately followed by the percentage sign <code class="language-markup">%</code>. Just as is the case with all other units in CSS, there isn't a space between the '%' and the number.</p>
<p>Many length properties use percentages, such as <a  title=""><code class="language-markup">width</code></a>, <a  title=""><code class="language-markup">margin</code></a> and <a  title=""><code class="language-markup">padding</code></a>. Percentages can also be seen in <a  title=""><code class="language-markup">font-size</code></a>, where the size of the text is directly related to the size of its parent.</p>
<div >
 <strong>Note:</strong> only calculated values are inherited. So, even if a percentage value is used on the parent property, a real value, like a width in pixel for a <a  title=""><code class="language-markup">&lt;length&gt;</code></a> value, will be accessible on the inherited property, not the percentage value.</div>
<h3>Interpolation</h3>
<p>Values of the <code class="language-markup">&lt;percentage&gt;</code> CSS data type can be interpolated in order to allow animations. In that case they are interpolated as real, floating-point numbers. The speed of the interpolation is determined by the <a  title="timing-function">timing function</a> associated with the animation.</p>
