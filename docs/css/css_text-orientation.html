<p>The <code class="language-markup">text-orientation</code> <a  title="CSS">CSS</a> property defines the orientation of the text in a line. This property only has an effect in vertical mode, that is when <a  title="The writing-mode CSS property defines whether lines of text are laid out horizontally or vertically and the direction in which blocks progress."><code class="language-markup">writing-mode</code></a> is not <code class="language-markup">horizontal-tb</code>. It is useful to control the display of writing in languages using vertical script, but also to deal with vertical table headers.</p>
