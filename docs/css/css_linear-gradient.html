<p>The CSS <code class="language-markup">linear-gradient()</code> function creates an <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;image&gt;</code></a> which represents a linear gradient of colors. The result of this function is an object of the CSS <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;gradient&gt;</code></a> data type. Like any other gradient, a CSS linear gradient is not a CSS <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;color&gt;</code></a> but an image with <a  title="en/CSS/image#no_intrinsic">no intrinsic dimensions</a>; that is, it has neither natural or preferred size, nor ratio. Its concrete size will match the one of the element it applies to.</p>

<p>Linear gradients are defined by an axis, the <em>gradient line</em>, with each point on it being of a different color. Perpendicular lines to the gradient-line have one single color, the one of the point on the gradient line.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><img alt="linear-gradient.png" src="/files/3537/linear-gradient.png" style="float: left; width: 309px; height: 383px;"></p>

<p>The gradient line is defined by the center of the box containing the gradient image and by an angle. The color of the gradient is defined by different points, the starting point, the ending point and, in between, optional stop-color points.</p>

<p>The starting point is the point on the gradient line where the color starts. It is defined by the intersection between the gradient line and a perpendicular passing by the box corner which is in the same quadrant.</p>

<p>Similarly the ending point is the point on the gradient line where the final color is reached. It can also be defined by an intersection between the gradient line and a perpendicular line issued by the nearby corner, but is more easily defined as the symmetric of the starting point, when a point reflection with an origin confounded with the center of the box.</p>

<p>These somewhat complex definitions of the starting and ending points lead to an interesting property sometimes called <em>magic corners</em> : the nearby corners of the starting and ending points also have the same color as the respective starting and ending points.</p>

<p>More than just the starting-point and ending-point colors can be specified.  By defining additional color-stop points on the gradient line, the web developer can create a more customized transition between the starting and ending colors, or provide for a multi-color gradient. </p>

<p>The linear-gradient syntax does not allow for repeating gradients, but by using color-stop points, a similar effect can be achieved.  For true repeating gradients, use the <a  title="The CSS repeating-linear-gradient function creates an &lt;image> of a repeating gradients. It works similarly, and takes the same arguments, to the basic linear gradients, as described by linear-gradient(), but it automatically repeats the color stops infinitely in both directions, with their positions shifted by multiples of the length of a basic linear gradient (the difference between the last color stop's position and the first one's position)."><code class="language-markup">repeating-linear-gradient()</code></a> CSS property.</p>

<p>When the position of a color-stop point is implicitly defined, it is placed half-way between the point that precedes it and the one that follows it.  The position can also be explicitly defined by using a <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;length&gt;</code></a> or a <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;percentage&gt;</code></a> CSS data type.</p>

<div >Gradients are defined as CSS <code class="language-markup">&lt;image&gt;</code> data types; they can be used only where an image data type is required. For this reason, <code class="language-markup">linear-gradient</code> won't work on <a  title="The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element, either through a color value or the keyword transparent."><code class="language-markup">background-color</code></a> and other properties requesting <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;color&gt;</code></a>.</div>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

                  \---------------------------------/ \----------------------------/
                    Definition of the gradient line        List of color stops  

where <code class="language-markup">&lt;side-or-corner&gt; = [left | right] || [top | bottom]</code>
  and <code class="language-markup">&lt;color-stop&gt;     = &lt;color&gt; [ &lt;percentage&gt; | &lt;length&gt; ]?</code>
</code></pre>

<pre>linear-gradient( 45deg, blue, red );           /* A gradient on 45deg axis starting blue and finishing red */
linear-gradient( to left top, blue, red);      /* A gradient going from the bottom right to the top left starting blue and

</code></pre>

<h3 >Values</h3>

<dl>
 <dt><code class="language-markup">&lt;side-or-corner&gt;</code></dt>
 <dd>Represents the position of the starting-point of the gradient line. It consists of two keywords: the first one indicates the horizontal side, <code class="language-markup">left</code> or <code class="language-markup">right</code>, and the second one the vertical side, <code class="language-markup">top</code> or <code class="language-markup">bottom</code>. The order is not relevant and each of the keyword is optional.<br>
 The values <code class="language-markup">to top</code>, <code class="language-markup">to bottom</code>, <code class="language-markup">to left</code> and <code class="language-markup">to right</code> are translated into the angles <code class="language-markup">0deg</code>, <code class="language-markup">180deg</code>, <code class="language-markup">270deg</code>, <code class="language-markup">90deg</code> respectively. The others are translated into an angle that let the starting-point to be in the same quadrant than the described corner and so that the line defined by the starting-point and the corner is perpendicular to the gradient line. That way, the color described by the <code class="language-markup">&lt;color-stop&gt;</code> will exactly apply to the corner point. This is sometimes called the "<em>magic corner</em>" property. The end-point of the gradient line is the symmetrical point of the starting-point on the other direction of the center box.</dd>
 <dt><code class="language-markup">&lt;angle&gt;</code></dt>
 <dd>An angle of direction for the gradient. See <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;angle&gt;</code></a>.</dd>
 <dt><code class="language-markup">&lt;color-stop&gt;</code></dt>
 <dd>This value is comprised of a <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;color&gt;</code></a> value, followed by an optional stop position (either a percentage or a <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;length&gt;</code></a> along the gradient axis).<br>
 Rendering of color-stops in CSS gradients follows the same rules as color-stops in SVG gradients.</dd>

<h3 >History of the syntax</h3>

<p>The syntax of <code class="language-markup">linear-gradient</code> has evolved since the <a   title="http://www.webkit.org/blog/175/introducing-css-gradients/">first Apple proposal</a> implemented in 2008:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">-webkit-gradient(&lt;type&gt;, &lt;point&gt; [, &lt;radius&gt;]?, &lt;point&gt; [, &lt;radius&gt;]? [, &lt;stop&gt;]*)</code>
</code></pre>

<p>In the original syntax, the same function was used to create both linear and radial gradients.  However, the parameters needed in each case were different, resulting in a syntax that varied with the value of the first parameter.  The situation became more complicated if  other types of gradients, like conical gradients, were added, requiring the use of functions and non-standard or inconsistent css value specifications.  No draft was proposed to the W3C.</p>

<p>An alternative syntax was proposed and implemented by Mozilla in 2009.  In this syntax, two CSS functions would be required; one for linear gradients, and the other for radial gradients. However, this syntax never shipped in a released product.  A third syntax was proposed.  This third syntax simplified the syntax for linear gradients to:</p>

<pre>-moz-linear-gradient(<code class="language-markup">[ [ [top | bottom] || [left | right] ],]? &lt;color-stop&gt;[, &lt;color-stop&gt;]+);</code>
</code></pre>

<p>The new syntax did not require the <code class="language-markup">to()</code>, <code class="language-markup">from()</code>and <code class="language-markup">color-stop()</code> functions, so they were dropped. The order of the <code class="language-markup">top</code>/<code class="language-markup">bottom</code> and <code class="language-markup">left</code>/<code class="language-markup">right</code> keywords was also recognized as unimportant, so Mozilla removed the constraint of having <code class="language-markup">top</code>/<code class="language-markup">bottom</code> defined first. </p>

<p>But the new syntax had still had one drawback: it allowed only vertical and horizontal gradients.  Finally, the syntax below was proposed to the W3C.  Following two more changes to solve the limitation on the direction of gradients, it was added to the CSS Images Values and Content Replacement Level 3 draft in 2011.</p>

<ul>
 <li>The support of an <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;angle&gt;</code></a> as an origin, allowing gradients of any direction.</li>
 <li>The definition of the magic corner algorithm which eases the work of Web developers by allowing an easy definition of the exact color at the corners.</li>
</ul>

<p>The color interpolation is also defined as happening in the pre-multiplied color space, in order to prevent non esthetic grey to appear when using color with different opacity. This syntax was implemented, prefixed, by both Webkit, without dropping the original one, and Trident (IE 10):</p>

<pre>linear-gradient(<code class="language-markup"> [ </code>[ <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;angle&gt;</code></a> | <code class="language-markup">[top | bottom] || [left | right] ],]? &lt;color-stop&gt;[, &lt;color-stop&gt;]+);</code>
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, the addition of the <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;angle&gt;</code></a> values to the syntax introduced an incoherence: the angle indicates a destination, but the keywords indicate a starting point.<a   title="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0377.html"># </a>This was fixed by a new syntax where the keyword are directions too, and preceded by the <code class="language-markup">to</code> keyword.</p>

<pre>linear-gradient(<code class="language-markup">[ [ </code>[ <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;angle&gt;</code></a> | to <code class="language-markup">[top | bottom] || [left | right] ],]? &lt;color-stop&gt;[, &lt;color-stop&gt;]+);</code>
</code></pre>

<p>This should be the final syntax.</p>

<p>A last semantic curiosity still exists between the prefixed variants and the unprefixed proposal. Following the initial Apple proposal, the prefixed variants of the syntax all uses the an <a  title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">&lt;angle&gt;</code></a> defined like polar angles, that is with <code class="language-markup">0deg</code> representing the East. To be coherent with the rest of CSS, the specification defines an angle with <code class="language-markup">0deg</code> representing the North. To prevent sites using prefixed version of the property to get suddenly broken, even when adapting to the otherwise forward-compatible final syntax, they keep the original angle definition (<code class="language-markup">0deg</code> = East<code class="language-markup">)</code>. They will switch to the correct spec when unprefixing the property. Also, as they aren't incompatible, Gecko supports, prefixed, both the syntax with the <code class="language-markup">to</code> keyword and without. Here again, the syntax without the keyword will be dropped when unprefixing.</p>
