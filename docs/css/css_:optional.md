## :optional

### Summary

The `:optional` CSS [pseudo-class][0] represents any [`<input>`][1] element that does not have the `[required][2]` attribute set on it. This allows forms to easily indicate optional fields, and to style them accordingly.

To provide an appearance for required form fields, the [`:required`][3] pseudo-class may be used.

### Examples

See [`:invalid`][4] for an example.
