<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-markup">::selection</code> CSS pseudo-element applies rules to the portion of a document that has been highlighted (e.g. selected with the mouse or another pointing device) by the user.</p>

<p>Only a small subset of CSS properties can be used in a rule using <code class="language-markup">::selection</code> in its selector: <a  title="The CSS color property sets the foreground color of an element's text content, and its decorations. It doesn't affect any other characteristic of the element; it should really be called text-color and would have been named so, save for historical reasons and its appearance in CSS Level 1."><code class="language-markup">color</code></a>, <a  title="The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element, either through a color value or the keyword transparent."><code class="language-markup">background-color</code></a>, <a  title="The cursor CSS property specifies the mouse cursor displayed when the mouse pointer is over an element."><code class="language-markup">cursor</code></a>, <a  title="The CSS outline property is a shorthand property for setting one or more of the individual outline properties outline-style, outline-width and outline-color in a single declaration. In most cases the use of this shortcut is preferable and more convenient."><code class="language-markup">outline</code></a>, <a  title="The text-decoration CSS property is used to set the text formatting to underline, overline, line-through or blink. Underline and overline decorations are positioned under the text, line-through over it."><code class="language-markup">text-decoration</code></a>, <a   title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code class="language-markup">text-emphasis-color</code></a> and <a  title="The text-shadow CSS property adds shadows to text. It accepts a comma-separated list of shadows to be applied to the text and text-decorations of the element."><code class="language-markup">text-shadow</code></a>. Note that, in particular, <a  title="Technical review completed."><code class="language-markup">background-image</code></a> is ignored, like any other property.</p>

<div >
<p><code class="language-markup">text-shadow</code> in <code class="language-markup">::selection</code> is supported by Chrome, Safari and Firefox 17+.</p>
</div>

<div >Though this pseudo-element was in drafts of CSS Selectors Level 3, it was removed during the Candidate Recommendation phase,Â  as it appeared that its behavior was under-specified, especially with nested elements, and interoperability wasn't achieved <a   title="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Oct/0268.html">(based on discussion in the W3C Style mailing list)</a>.<br>
<br>
The <code class="language-markup">::selection</code> pseudo-element has been added again in <a  >Pseudo-Elements Level 4</a>.</div>
