## :required

### Summary

The `:required` CSS [pseudo-class][0] represents any [`<input>`][1] element that has the `[required][2]` attribute set on it. This allows forms to easily indicate which fields must have valid data before the form can be submitted.

The [`:optional`][3] pseudo-class may be used to provide an appearance for optional form fields.

### Examples

See [`:invalid`][4] for an example.
